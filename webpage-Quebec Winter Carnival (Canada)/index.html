        <p class="black">The Quebec Winter Carnival is more than just 
            a celebration—it's a testament to the resilience
             and joy of the Quebec people. Established in 1955 
             and revived from traditions dating back to 1894, 
             this festival transforms the coldest season into 
             a magical experience filled with creativity, 
             community, and cultural pride.</p>
